When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository when working on a project with multiple people.
A remote repository could also be useful when I am working in the project in several computers. This way I can easily "sync"
my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would like to pull changes manually because new features in programs require multiple commits and I might get premature changes.
