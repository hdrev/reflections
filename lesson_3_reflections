When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository when working on a project with multiple people.
A remote repository could also be useful when I am working in the project in several computers. This way I can easily "sync"
my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would like to pull changes manually because new features in programs require multiple committs and I might get premature changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are used when working on experimental features that someday might be added to the main program (ie master branch), clones are to copy entire repositories either locally or remotely. Forks only exist in the context of github and are used to clone repositories between different github accounts.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is useful when you are going to be offline for a while, and you need to know the latest changes in the repository.
